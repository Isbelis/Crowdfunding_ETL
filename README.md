project-2-group-16
This mini-project involved extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) crowdfunding data into a structured database. The project was divided into the following subsections:

1. Created the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
2. Created the Campaign DataFrame
3. Created the Contacts DataFrame
   - ***Option 1:*** Used Python dictionary methods
   - ***Option 2:*** Used regular expressions to parse the data
4. Created the Crowdfunding Database

# Usage
- **ERD Design:** Used QuickDBD to sketch the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and visualize the relationships between the tables.
- **Data Extraction and Analysis:** Wrote SQL queries to extract and analyze data from the database.
- **Data Loading:** Used SQLAlchemy or another ORM to load data from the DataFrames into the database.
- **Visualization:** Used Python libraries such as Matplotlib, OS, and Seaborn to create visualizations.

# Folder Structure

 - **ERD Folder:** Contains the ERD files as folowing:
   `QuickDBD-Crowdfunding ERD.png`

   `Crowdfunding ERD - project-2-group-.txt`

  - **Resources Folder:** Contains CSV files and the original dataset used to create DataFrames.

### - Output Folder: Contained visualizations in PNG format and CSV files from queries used to create DataFrames for analysis.
